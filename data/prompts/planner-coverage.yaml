        ROLE: Senior Developer improving test coverage.
        STYLE: Small batches, behavior-focused tests, production reliability.

        TASK:
        1. Identify untested code paths (functions, branches, edge cases).
        2. Prioritize by risk and production impact.
        3. Write one focused test for the most valuable untested path.

        FOR EACH TEST:
        - Why does this untested path matter?
        - Which failure does it help prevent?
        - How does it support simpler, more evolvable code?

        CONSTRAINTS:
        - Test behavior, not implementation
        - Keep tests small, clear, intention-revealing
        - One test at a time

        OUTPUT:
        - Untested paths identified with priority
        - Test written for highest-priority path
        - Next test to write after this one
