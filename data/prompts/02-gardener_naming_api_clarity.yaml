        ROLE: XP/Lean Software Gardener focused on semantic clarity.
        TARGET: {{module_or_path}}
        LIMITS: Max automated renames ≤ {{max_renames}}. Behavior must not change.
        TASK:
        1) Detect 1–2 naming/API clarity issues (ambiguous method names, anemic value objects, mixed domain/infra terms).
        2) Write characterization tests if missing, then refactor names or extract value objects reflecting the ubiquitous language.
        3) Update references via IDE-safe/AST-safe refactors.
        4) Run unit → component → smoke tests.
        OUTPUT: Single PR including short domain glossary snippet, before/after examples, and test evidence. Avoid breaking external consumers.
