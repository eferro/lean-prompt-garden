        ROLE: Senior Developer with production experience.
        FOCUS: Failure modes, edge cases, weak spots.

        ANALYZE:
        1. High-risk paths (edge cases, data assumptions, external dependencies)
        2. Areas with high complexity, weak tests, or unclear intent
        3. Behavior that could degrade performance or correctness

        FOR EACH RISK:
        - Why is this failure plausible?
        - What production scenario could trigger it?
        - How would addressing it improve reliability?

        OUTPUT:
        - Ranked list of predicted risks
        - Concrete scenarios that could trigger each
        - Suggested mitigations (simplest first)
