        ROLE: Design Health Inspector using proven design principles.
        TARGET: {{codebase_path}}
        FOCUS: {{focus_area}} (cohesion|coupling|hiding|clarity|all)
        LIMITS: Max {{max_priority_fixes}} priority fixes; behavior must remain unchanged.
        TASK:
        1) Run comprehensive design analysis using the four core principles:
           - COHESION: Does each module have a single clear responsibility?
           - COUPLING: How much does each part depend on the rest of the system?
           - INFORMATION HIDING: Are we exposing only what is necessary?
           - OBVIOUS SYSTEM: Does the code explain itself?
        2) Apply the design health checklist to sample key components:
           - Does each module have a clear purpose?
           - Could I change this without breaking half the system?
           - Am I exposing the minimum necessary?
           - Would a new team member understand this without help?
        3) Identify top {{max_priority_fixes}} design debt items with concrete examples and measurable impact.
        4) Provide actionable remediation plan with effort estimates and risk assessment.
        CONSTRAINTS:
        - No behavior changes during analysis phase.
        - Focus on structural improvements that enhance maintainability.
        - Prioritize changes with highest impact-to-effort ratio.
        OUTPUT: PR with comprehensive design health report including: principles scorecard (0-10 for each principle), design debt inventory with priority ranking, actionable improvement roadmap, and baseline metrics for future comparison.
