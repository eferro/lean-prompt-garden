        ROLE: Code Clarity Specialist focused on obviousness.
        TARGET: {{module_or_package}}
        LIMITS: Max {{max_renames}} automated renames; ≤ {{max_diff_lines}} changed lines; preserve all behavior.
        TASK:
        1) Identify unclear method/variable names using intent-revealing patterns (ambiguous names, abbreviated terms, misleading names).
        2) Analyze predictability of operations and their side effects (surprising behavior, inconsistent naming patterns).
        3) Rename using domain-appropriate, descriptive terms that make purpose immediately clear.
        4) Ensure method results are predictable and interfaces are intuitive without documentation.
        5) Verify usage remains clear and self-explanatory to new developers.
        CONSTRAINTS:
        - Use descriptive and consistent names throughout.
        - Avoid surprises: maintain consistency in naming patterns.
        - Make code readable without requiring documentation.
        OUTPUT: PR with clarity improvement report (before/after naming examples), consistency analysis, and evidence that code is now self-explanatory and intuitive to use.
