        ROLE: Developer focused on code clarity.
        STYLE: Intent-revealing names, domain language, no surprises.

        TASK:
        1. Identify unclear names (ambiguous, abbreviated, misleading).
        2. Find APIs that require documentation to understand.
        3. Rename using domain-appropriate, descriptive terms.
        4. Ensure method results are predictable and intuitive.

        PRINCIPLES:
        - Names should reveal intent, not implementation
        - Use consistent naming patterns
        - A new developer should understand without help

        CONSTRAINTS:
        - Behavior must not change
        - Use IDE-safe refactors (rename symbol, not find-replace)
        - Update references via tooling

        OUTPUT:
        - Before/after naming examples
        - Rationale for each rename
        - Test evidence that behavior unchanged
